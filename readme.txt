Easily import SEO settings from any XML or CSV file to Yoast WordPress SEO with the Yoast WordPress SEO add-on for WP All Import.

== Description ==

The Yoast WordPress SEO add-on for [WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import/) makes it easy to bulk import your SEO setting to the Yoast WordPress SEO plugin in less than 10 minutes.

The left side of the plugin looks just like Yoast WordPress SEO, and the right side displays the data from your XML/CSV file.

**Drag & drop the data from your XML or CSV into the Yoast WordPress SEO fields to import them.**

= Why you should use the Yoast WordPress SEO add-on for WP All Import =

* Import new posts, pages, or custom post types and configure their SEO settings all in the same import.

* Update SEO settings for existing posts, pages, or custom post types already published on your site.

* Compatible with all other WP All Import add-ons.

* Complete support - configure all available SEO settings for your posts, including social media images.

= Yoast WordPress SEO CSV Imports =
Of course, XML files can have complex structures, but for CSV files, you can easily edit them and change the column names.

When importing CSV files, you should use standard UTF-8 character encoding if you are having any trouble with CSV imports containing special characters. But other than that, there are no special requirements.

This importer is the best option for Yoast WordPress SEO CSV import tasks - it is extremely flexible when doing CSV imports because you don't need to edit your CSV files to import them to Yoast WordPress SEO. WP All Import can import ANY CSV file to Yoast WordPress SEO. You don't need to lay out your data in a specific way and you don't need your CSV to have specific column names. WP All Import's drag & drop interface provides you with a visual way to map the columns in your CSV file to the appropriate fields in Yoast WordPress SEO.
